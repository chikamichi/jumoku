p=. **Build and manipulate tree structures in Ruby.**

## Synopsis

Evergreen provides you with tree structures and related tools to perform manipulation and computation the easy way. Trees are a subset of graphs, which are used in a whole slew of computer science and mathematical problems: network modelization, datasets storage, scientific computation, load balancing, games and AI designs, â€¦ Trees are frequently used to mimic hierarchal structures such as filesystems, or modelize decisionnal patterns, for instance.

Evergreen is built upon [Graphy](http://github.com/bruce/graphy "Graphy on Github"), a ruby-powered Graph Theory library, and aims at being a fully-fledged, pithy solution for tree-like structures managment. See below for additionnal information about graphs, trees, arborescences, why they're different and how to make good use of them.

## A few words about *trees*

A Tree is a graph subject to three basic constraints: nodes are all connected, they must not form any loop, and the branches binding nodes have no preferential direction. A tree is not compelled to have a root node and leaves as you may think *prima facie*. Trees with such features are called arborescences and Evergreen has support for them, too.

Evergreen (*currently under early development stage*) provides you with the following structures:

* RawTree: a tree-graph with only basic features
* **Tree**: a tree-graph with extended features built upon RawTree. That's what you'd want to use as a basic tree structure
* AVLTree (*not yet*)
* RedBlackTree (*not yet*)
* **Arborescence** (*not yet*): the structure everybody thinks of when asked about "trees", with a root, internal nodes and leaves

You can also extend those structures with hybrid behaviors (not Graph Theory compliant but may be useful):

* Directed (*not yet*): relax the *undirected* constraint
* Loopy (*not yet*): relax the *acyclic* constraint
* Atomic (*not yet*): relax the *connected* constraint

## Basic usage

To create an instance of a tree, you may use either inheritance or mixins.

### Inheritance or direct initialization

    class MyTree < Evergreen::Tree; end
    tree = MyTree.new

    # or even simpler:
    tree = Evergreen::Tree.new

### Mixing-in a "builder" module

    class MyTree
      include Evergreen::RawTreeBuilder
    end
    tree = MyTree.new

Actually the RawTree class is nothing but the mixin code snippet above.

### What you get

`tree` is now a Tree object, shipping with some default options:

* it is a valid tree *per se* (an undirected, acyclic, connected graph)
* Evergreen API's methods will ensure it remains so
* it has no constraint on its branching number (the number of branches per node)

## Install, first steps and bootstraping

In order to play with Evergreen, you must:

    # install a fork of Graphy
    git clone git://github.com/chikamichi/graphy.git
    cd graphy
    rake install

    cd..

    # install Evergreen
    git clone git://github.com/chikamichi/evergreen.git
    cd evergreen
    rake install

Now you can play in IRB:

    $ irb
    ruby-1.9.1-p378 > require 'evergreen'
    => true 
    ruby-1.9.1-p378 > include Evergreen # so you won't have to prefix everything with "Evergreen::"
    => Object 
    ruby-1.9.1-p378 > t = Tree.new
    => #<Evergreen::Tree:0x000000020d5ac8 @vertex_dict={}, @vertex_labels={}, @edge_labels={}, @allow_loops=false, @parallel_edges=false, @edgelist_class=Set> 
    ruby-1.9.1-p378 > t.methods
    => # lot of stuff hopefully :)

A good way to get you started is by [reading the doc online](http://rdoc.info/projects/chikamichi/evergreen "Evergreen on rdoc.info"). You can locally generate the doc with any of the following commands (you'll need to have the `yard` gem installed):

    rake yard
    yardoc

Be sure to take a look at the tests in `spec/` as well, as they document the public API extensively.

## What about graphs?

Trees are just simple graphs, with specific constraints on edges (branches) and vertices (nodes). In graph theory, a tree is defined as a graph which is undirected, acyclic and connected. A forest is a disjoint union of trees. Let's review those constraints:

* undirected: the branches of a tree have no direction;
* acyclic: a cycle is defined as a path such that the starting node and the ending node are the same. Such paths are forbidden in a tree;
* connected: a tree is such that pair of distinct nodes can be connected through some path (not a cycle).

This is restrictive, but not *that* restrictive. Instinctively, a tree structure would rather be described as an arborescence, with a root and some leaves. That's what you would use to use to modelize nested directories, for instance. Such a structure has additional constraints, and it makes sense to derive it from the more generalist tree*-as-in-graph-theory* structure, under the name "arborescence".

Therefore, it is easy to implement those structures using graphs. Fortunately, several ruby graph libraries exist (and even a ruby binding for the igraph C backend, but that'd be a burden to use). Evergreen makes use of the most up-to-date project among those available, [Graphy](http://github.com/bruce/graphy "Graphy on Github").
