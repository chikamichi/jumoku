module Evergreen
  # This module provides the basic routines needed to implement the specialized builders:
  # {TreeBuilder}, {BinaryTreeBuilder}, â€¦ each of them streamlining {RawTreeBuilder}'s
  # behavior. Those implementations are under the control of the {TreeAPI}.
  #
  # A {RawTree} sticks to the standard definition of trees in Graph Theory: undirected,
  # connected, acyclic graphs. Using Graphy::UndirectedGraphBuilder as its backends, 
  # {RawTreeBuilder} ensures the two remaining constraints are satisfied (connected and
  # acyclic).
  #
  # Note that a node can be any Object. There is no "node type", therefore arguments which
  # are expected to be nodes are simply labelled as "`node`". A nice object type to us as
  # a node would be an OpenStruct or an OpenObject (from the Facets library), as it makes
  # nodes versatile handlers.
  #
  # This builder defines a few methods not required by the API so as to maintain consistency
  # in the DSL (for instance, aliasing `*vertex` to `*node`, etc.)
