module Evergreen
  # This module provides the basic routines needed to implement the specialized builders:
  # {TreeBuilder}, {BinaryTreeBuilder}, â€¦ each of them streamlining {RawTreeBuilder}'s
  # behavior. Those implementations are under the control of the {TreeAPI}.
  #
  # A {RawTree} sticks to the standard definition of trees in Graph Theory: undirected,
  # connected, acyclic graphs. Using Graphy::UndirectedGraphBuilder as its backend, 
  # {RawTreeBuilder} ensures the two remaining constraints are satisfied (connected and
  # acyclic). {RawTreeBuilder RawTree} offers limited functionalities, therefore the main
  # tree structure you'll likely to use is its extended version, {TreeBuilder Tree}. A
  # {Tree} share the same behavior but is a fully-fledged object with user-friendly public
  # methods built upon {RawTree}'s internals.
  #
  # Note that a node can be any Object. There is no "node type", therefore arguments which
  # are expected to be nodes are simply labelled as "`node`". A nice object type to us as
  # a node would be an OpenStruct or an
  # [OpenObject](http://facets.rubyforge.org/apidoc/api/more/classes/OpenObject.html)
  # (from the Facets library), as it turns nodes into versatile handlers.
  #
  # This builder defines a few methods not required by the API so as to maintain consistency
  # in the DSL.
