# Jumoku provides you with several modules and classes to build and manipulate
# tree-graphs.
#
# A tree is a structure composed of branches binding nodes. Branches may be
# directed (arcs) or undirected (edges). When a there is only one general
# direction (flow), there is a root node, and one or several leaf nodes. A
# directed, uni-flow tree where each node only branches in once and branches
# out once is called a path. For more information on what a tree-graph is and
# how you could make use of it, see the README.
#
# Two basic implementations are available: undirected trees
# ({RawUndirectedTree}) and directed trees ({RawDirectedTree}). They offer
# limited features, so one will certainly drop to their civilized siblings:
#
#  * {Tree} is derived from an undirected tree and sticks to the mathematical
# tree definition.
#  * {Arborescence} is derived from a directed tree and is likely to be used
# as the basis to modelize hierarchy structures, such as a family tree, a file
# browserâ€¦
#
# A node can be any Object: there is no "node type". A nice object "type" to
# use as a node may be an OpenStruct or an OpenHash (from the Facets library),
# but really any object is valid.
#
# Jumoku allows you to enable some strategies when creating a new tree. For
# instance, you may enable an edge/arc labeling strategy, which will cause
# indexing of branches as they are added. Jumoku provides a few basic
# strategies mixin, and one may implement custom ones.
