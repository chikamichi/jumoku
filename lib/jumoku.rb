# Jumoku provides you with several modules and classes to build and manipulate
# tree graphs. Two basic implementations are available: undirected trees
# ({RawUndirectedTree}) and directed trees ({RawDirectedTree}).
#
# {Tree} is derived from the undirected flavour and sticks to the mathematical
# tree definition. {Arborescence} is derived from the directed flavour and is
# likely to be used as the basis to modelize hierarchy structures, such as a
# family tree, a file browserâ€¦
#
# Note that a node can be any Object. There is no "node type", therefore
# arguments which re expected to be nodes are simply labelled as "`node`"
# within this documentation. A nice object type to use as a node may be an
# OpenStruct or an [OpenObject](http://facets.rubyforge.org/apidoc/api/more/classes/OpenObject.html)
# (from the Facets library), both turning nodes into versatile handlers.
